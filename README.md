# Movie Recommender System

ðŸš€ **Excited to Share My Latest Project!** ðŸŽ¥

I've been working on a Movie Recommender System using Streamlit, and I'm thrilled with how it's turned out! This system allows users to explore movie recommendations and see movie posters fetched in real-time using the OMDb API.

## Features

- ðŸ›  **Integrated OMDb API**: Fetches high-quality movie posters to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- ðŸŽ¡ **Image Carousel Component**: Showcases movie posters dynamically, enhancing the overall user experience.
- ðŸ–¥ **Full-Screen Responsive Layout**: Utilizes custom CSS to ensure the application is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience on any device.
- ðŸ”¥ **Recommendation Engine**: Uses a similarity matrix to suggest movies based on user preferences, with movie posters displayed in a grid format.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset**: The system uses a dataset of movies with titles and descriptions.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Computes similarity scores between movies to generate recommendations.
4. **Streamlit App**: Provides an interactive interface for users to select movies and view recommendations.
